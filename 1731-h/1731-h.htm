iii</span>PREFACE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> poem, though new in the sense
of being now for the first time printed, was written some four
years ago, about the same date as the <i>Hound of Heaven</i> in
my former volume.</p>
<p>One image in the <i>Proem</i> was an unconscious plagiarism
from the beautiful image in Mr. Patmore&rsquo;s <i>St.
Valentine&rsquo;s Day</i>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;O baby Spring,<br />
That flutter&rsquo;st sudden &rsquo;neath the breast of Earth,<br
/>
A month before the birth!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finding I could not disengage it without injury to the passage
in which it is embedded, I have preferred to leave it, with this
acknowledgment to a Poet rich enough to lend to the poor.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary&rsquo;s spoilt nursling! wert thou wont to
go?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or <i>thou</i>, Sun-god and

Could singer pipe one tiniest linnet-lay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While Song did turn away his face from song?<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; In spirit or in body hale for long,&mdash;<br />

then, thou art here!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the
earth&rsquo;s leth&egrave;d ear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy voice of light rings out exultant, strong;<br />
Through dreams she stirs and murmurs at that summons dear:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From its red leash my heart
strains tamelessly,<br />
For Spring leaps in the womb of the young year!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nay, was it not brought forth
before,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And we waited,
to behold it,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Till the
sun&rsquo;s hand should unfold it,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What the year&rsquo;s young bosom
bore?<br />
Even so; it came, nor knew we that it came,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the
sun&rsquo;s eclipse.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet the birds have plighted
vows,<br />
And from the branches pipe each other&rsquo;s name;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet the season all the boughs<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has kindled to the
finger-tips,&mdash;<br />
Mark yonder, how the long laburnum drips<br />
Its jocund spilth of fire, its honey of wild flame!<br />
Yea, and myself put on swift quickening,<br />
And answer to the presence of a sudden Spring.<br />
From cloud-zoned pinnacles of the secret spirit<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>Song falls precipitant in dizzying streams;<br />
And, like a mountain-hold when war-shouts stir it,<br />
The mind&rsquo;s recess&egrave;d fastness casts to light<br />
Its gleaming multitudes, that from every height<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfurl the flaming of a thousand dreams.<br />
Now therefore, thou who bring&rsquo;st the year to birth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who guid&rsquo;st the bare and dabbled feet of
May;<br />
Sweet stem to that rose Christ, who from the earth<br />
Suck&rsquo;st our poor prayers, conveying them to Him;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Be aidant, tender Lady, to my lay!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of thy two maidens somewhat must I say,<br />
Ere shadowy twilight lashes, drooping, dim<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Day&rsquo;s dreamy eyes from us;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ere eve has struck and furled<br />
The beamy-textured tent transpicuous,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of webb&egrave;d coerule wrought and woven calms,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whence has paced forth the
lambent-footed sun.<br />
And Thou disclose my flower of song upcurled,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who from Thy fair irradiant
palms<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Scatterest all love and loveliness as alms;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Yea, Holy One,<br />
Who coin&rsquo;st Thyself to beauty for the world!</p>

the leaves sing,<br />
The leaves dance in the breath of the Spring.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I bid them
dance,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I bid them sing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the limpid
glance<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of my ladyling;<br />
For the gift to the Spring of a dewier spring,<br />
For God&rsquo;s good grace of this ladyling!<br />
I know in the lane, by the hedgerow track,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The long, broad grasses underneath<br />
Are warted with rain like a toad&rsquo;s knobbed back;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But here May weareth a rainless wreath.<br />
In the new-sucked milk of the sun&rsquo;s bosom<br />
Is dabbled the mouth of the daisy-blossom;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The smouldering rosebud chars through its sheath;<br
/>
The lily stirs her snowy limbs,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>Ere she
swims<br />
Naked up through her cloven green,<br />
Like the wave-born Lady of Love Hellene;<br />
And the scattered snowdrop exquisite<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Twinkles and
gleams,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As if the showers of the sunny beams<br />
Were splashed from the earth in drops of light.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is child of
Spring<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Casts its bud or blossoming<br />
Upon the stream of my delight.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Their voices</i>, <i>that scents are</i>,

&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And prank them out in holiday</i>,<br />

<h4><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>2.</h4>
<p class="poetry">While thus I stood in mazes bound<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of vernal sorcery,<br />
I heard a dainty dubious sound,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As of goodly melody;<br />
Which first was faint as if in swound,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then burst so suddenly<br />
In warring concord all around,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That, whence this thing might be,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To see<br />
The very marrow longed in me!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It seemed of air, it seemed of ground,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And never any witchery<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Drawn from pipe, or reed, or string,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Made such dulcet ravishing.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas like no earthly instrument,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet had something of them all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In its rise, and in its fall;<br />
As if in one sweet consort there were blent<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Those archetypes celestial<br />
Which our endeavouring instruments recall.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>So heavenly flutes made murmurous plain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To heavenly viols, that again<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash;Aching with music&mdash;wailed back pain;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Regals release their notes, which rise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Welling, like tears from heart to eyes;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the harp thrills with thronging sighs.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Horns in mellow flattering<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Parley with the cithern-string:&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hark!&mdash;the floating, long-drawn note<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Woos the throbbing cithern-string!</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Their pretty</i>, <i>pretty prating those
citherns sure upraise</i><br />
<i>For homage unto Sylvia</i>, <i>her sweet</i>, <i>feat
ways</i>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Those flutes do flute their vowelled lay</i>,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Their lovely languid language say</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>For lisping to Sylvia</i>;<br
/>
<i>Those viols&rsquo; lissom bowings break the heart of
May</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And harps harp their burthen</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>For singing to Sylvia</i>.</p>
<h4>3.</h4>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now at that music and that
mirth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rose, as &rsquo;twere, veils from earth;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>And I spied<br

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How beside<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bud, bell, bloom, an elf<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Stood, or was the flower itself<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Mid
radiant air<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the fair<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Frequence swayed in irised wavers.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some against the gleaming rims<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their bosoms prest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the kingcups, to the brims<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Filled with sun, and their white limbs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bath&egrave;d in those golden lavers;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some on the brown, glowing breast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of that Indian maid, the pansy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (Through its tenuous veils confest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of swathing light), in a quaint fancy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tied her knot of yellow favours;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Others dared open draw<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Snapdragon&rsquo;s dreadful jaw:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some, just sprung from out the soil,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sleeked and shook their rumpled fans<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dropt with sheen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>Of moony
green;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Others, not yet extricate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On their hands leaned their weight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And writhed them free with mickle toil,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Still folded in their veiny vans:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And all with an unsought accord<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sang together from the sward;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whence had come, and from sprites<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet unseen, those delights,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As of tempered musics blent,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which had given me such content.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For haply our best instrument,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pipe or cithern, stopped or strung,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Mimics but some spirit tongue.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Their amiable voices</i>, <i>I bid them

&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Their lovesome labours laid away</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>To linger out this holiday</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>In syllabling

<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next I saw, wonder-whist,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; How from the atmosphere a mist,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So it seemed, slow uprist;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And, looking from those elfin swarms,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was
&rsquo;ware<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How the air<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was all populous with forms<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the Hours, floating down,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like Nereids through a watery town.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some, with languors of waved arms,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fluctuous oared their flexile way;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some were borne half resupine<br />
On the a&euml;rial hyaline,<br />
Their fluid limbs and rare array<br />
Flickering on the wind, as quivers<br />
Trailing weed in running rivers;<br />
And others, in far prospect seen,<br />
Newly loosed on this terrene,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>Shot in piercing swiftness came,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With hair a-stream like pale and goblin flame.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As cryst&aacute;lline ice in water,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lay in air each faint daughter;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Inseparate (or but separate dim)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Circumfused wind from wind-like vest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wind-like vest from wind-like limb.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But outward from each lucid breast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When some passion left its haunt,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Radiate surge of colour came,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Diffusing blush-wise, palpitant,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dying all the filmy frame.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With some sweet tenderness they would<br />
Turn to an amber-clear and glossy gold;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or a fine sorrow, lovely to behold,<br />
Would sweep them as the sun and wind&rsquo;s joined flood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweeps a greening-sapphire sea;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or they would glow enamouredly<br />
Illustrious sanguine, like a grape of blood;<br />
Or with mantling poetry<br />
Curd to the tincture which the opal hath,<br />
Like rainbows thawing in a moonbeam bath.<br />
<a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>So paled
they, flushed they, swam they, sang melodiously.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Their chanting</i>, <i>soon fading</i>,

&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And colours take of holiday</i>,<br />

<h4>5.</h4>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, through those
translucencies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As grew my senses clearer clear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Did I see, and did I hear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How under an elm&rsquo;s canopy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wheeled a flight of Dryades<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Murmuring measured melody.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Gyre in gyre their treading was,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wheeling with an adverse flight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In twi-circle o&rsquo;er the grass,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>These to left, and those to right;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
All the band<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Link&egrave;d by each other&rsquo;s hand;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Decked in raiment stain&egrave;d as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The blue-helm&egrave;d aconite.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And they advance with flutter, with grace,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To the dance<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving on with a dainty pace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As blossoms mince it on river swells.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Over their heads their cymbals shine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Round each ankle gleams a twine<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of twinkling bells&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tune twirled golden from their cells.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Every step was a tinkling sound,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As they glanced in their dancing-ground,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Clouds in cluster with such a sailing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Float o&rsquo;er the light of the wasting moon,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; As the cloud of their gliding veiling<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Swung in the sway of the dancing-tune.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There was the clash of their cymbals clanging,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ringing of swinging bells clinging their feet;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the clang on wing it seemed a-hanging,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>Hovering round their dancing so fleet.&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I stirred, I rustled more than meet;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whereat they broke to the left and right,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With eddying robes like aconite<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Blue of helm;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I beheld to the foot o&rsquo; the elm.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>They have not tripped those dances</i>,

<i>To glad the heart of Sylvia</i>, <i>beholding of their

Aye, goddess, even for this.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Once, bright Sylviola! in days not far,<br />
Once&mdash;in that nightmare-time which still doth haunt<br />
My dreams, a grim, unbidden visitant&mdash;<br />

Forlorn, and faint, and stark,<br />
<a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>I had
endured through watches of the dark<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The abashless inquisition of each star,<br />
Yea, was the outcast mark<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of all those
heavenly passers&rsquo; scrutiny;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stood bound and
helplessly<br />
For Time to shoot his barb&egrave;d minutes at me;<br />
Suffered the trampling hoof of every hour<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In night&rsquo;s
slow-wheel&egrave;d car;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Until the tardy dawn dragged me at length<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From under those dread wheels; and, bled of
strength,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I waited the inevitable last.<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then there came
past<br />
A child; like thee, a spring-flower; but a flower<br />
Fallen from the budded coronal of Spring,<br />
And through the city-streets blown withering.<br />
She passed,&mdash;O brave, sad, lovingest, tender
thing!&mdash;<br />
And of her own scant pittance did she give,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That I might eat
and live:<br />
Then fled, a swift and trackless fugitive.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore I
kissed in thee<br />
The heart of Childhood, so divine for me;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="page20"></a><span

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And what unchildish days,<br />
Borne from me now, as then, a trackless fugitive.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore I kissed in thee<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her, child! and innocency,<br />
And spring, and all things that have gone from me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that shall never be;<br />
All vanished hopes, and all most hopeless bliss,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Came with thee to my kiss.<br />
And ah! so long myself had strayed afar<br />
From child, and woman, and the boon earth&rsquo;s green,<br />
And all wherewith life&rsquo;s face is fair beseen;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Journeying its journey bare<br />
Five suns, except of the all-kissing sun<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unkissed of
one;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Almost I had
forgot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The healing
harms,<br />
And whitest witchery, a-lurk in that<br />
Authentic cestus of two girdling arms:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I remembered not<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The subtle sanctities which dart<br />
From childish lips&rsquo; unvalued precious brush,<br />
<a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>Nor how it
makes the sudden lilies push<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, that thy
little kiss<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should be to me
all this,<br />
Let workaday wisdom blink sage lids thereat;<br />
Which towers a flight three hedgerows high, poor bat!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And straightway charts me out the empyreal air.<br
/>
Its chart I wing not by, its canon of worth<br />
Scorn not, nor reck though mine should breed it mirth:<br />
And howso thou and I may be disjoint,<br />
Yet still my falcon spirit makes her point<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the covert
where<br />
Thou, sweetest quarry, hast put in from her!</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
One unforgotten day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a sick child waking sees<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gazing on it from its hand,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So between thy father&rsquo;s
knees<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw
<i>thee</i> stand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And through my
hazes<br />
Of pain and fear thine eyes&rsquo; young wonder shone.<br />
Then, as flies scatter from a carrion,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or rooks in spreading gyres like broken smoke<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wheel, when some sound their quietude has broke,<br
/>
Fled, at thy countenance, all that doubting spawn:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The heart which I had questioned
spoke,<br />
A cry impetuous from its depths was drawn,&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;I take the omen of this face of dawn!&rdquo;<br />
And with the omen to my heart cam&rsquo;st thou.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even with a
spray of tears<br />
That one light draft was fixed there for the years.</p>
<p

now?&mdash;<br />
The hours I tread ooze memories of thee, Sweet!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneath my casual feet.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With rainfall as the lea,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

drenched with thee;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In little exquisite surprises<br

Bubbling deliciousness of thee arises<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
From sudden places,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the common traces<br />
Of my most lethargied and customed paces.</p>

tongue,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lagging by his side along;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a rusty-wing&egrave;d Death<br

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grating its low flight before,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Casting ribb&egrave;d shadows
o&rsquo;er<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The blank desert, blank and
tan:<br />
He lifts by hap toward where the morning&rsquo;s roots are<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
His weary stare,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sees, although they plashless mutes are,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set in a silver air<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fountains of gelid shoots are,<br />

A sight like innocence when one has sinned!<br />
A green and maiden freshness smiling there,<br />

Even so<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its lovely

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfurled not from an embryo;<br />
Born of full stature, lineal to control;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet a pigmy&rsquo;s yoke must undergo.<br />
Yet must keep pace and tarry, patient, kind,<br />
With its unwilling scholar, the dull, tardy mind;<br />

Whose low hands mete its paths, set ope and close its ways;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Which did me teach<br />
To make of Silence my familiar,<br />
Who hath the rich reversion of thy speech,<br />
Since the most charming sounds thy thought can wear,<br />
Cast off, fall to that pale attendant&rsquo;s share;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And thank the gift which made my
mind<br />
<a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>A
shadow-world, wherethrough the shadows wind<br />
Of all the loved and lovely of my kind.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a
maiden Saxon, folden,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As she flits, in
moon-drenched mist;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose curls streaming
flaxen-golden,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the misted
moonbeams kist,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dispread their filmy floating
silk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like honey
steeped in milk:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, vague goldenness remote,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through my thoughts I watch thee
float.<br />
When the snake summer casts her blazoned skin<br />
We find it at the turn of autumn&rsquo;s path,<br />
And think it summer that rewinded hath,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Joying therein;<br />
And this enamouring slough of thee, mine elf,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I take it for thyself;<br />
Content.&nbsp; Content?&nbsp; Yea, title it content.<br />
The very loves that belt thee must prevent<br />
My love, I know, with their legitimacy:<br />
As the metallic vapours, that are swept<br />
Athwart the sun, in his light intercept<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>The very
hues<br />
Which <i>their</i> conflagrant elements effuse.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, my love, my heart, my
fair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That only I should see thee
rare,<br />
Or tent to the hid core thy rarity,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This were a mournfulness more piercing far<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than that those other loves my own must bar,<br />
Or thine for others leave thee none for me.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on a
day whereof I think,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One shall dip his hand to drink<br

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In that still water of thy
soul,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And its imaged tremors race<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over thy joy-troubled face,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the intervolved reflections
roll<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From a shaken fountain&rsquo;s
brink,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With swift light wrinkling its
alcove.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the hovering wing of Love<br

The warm stain shall flit roseal on thy cheek,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, sweet blushet! whenas he,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One grace alone
I seek.<br />
Oh! may this treasure-galleon of my verse,<br />
Fraught with its golden passion, oared with cadent rhyme,<br />
Set with a towering press of fantasies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drop safely down
the time,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Leaving mine isl&egrave;d self behind it far<br />
Soon to be sunken in the abysm of seas,<br />
(As down the years the splendour voyages<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From some long ruined and night-submerg&egrave;d
star),<br />
And in thy subject sovereign&rsquo;s havening heart<br />
Anchor the freightage of its virgin ore;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adding its
wasteful more<br />
To his own overflowing treasury.<br />
So through his river mine shall reach thy sea,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bearing its
confluent part;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his pulse
mine shall thrill;<br />
And the quick heart shall quicken from the heart that&rsquo;s
still.</p>

The utmost aery traceried pinnacle.<br />
So; it is builded, the high tenement,<br />

Most like a palace of the Occident,<br />

So few therein to enter shall prevail!<br />
Scarce fewer could win way, if their desire<br />
A dragon baulked, with involuted spire,<br />

For at the elfin portal hangs a horn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which none can wind aright<br />

Whose lids the fay-wings brushed when he was born.<br />

Unbodied, yet to mortal seeing clear,<br />
Like sighs exhaled in eager atmosphere.<br />
From human haps and mutabilities<br />

Which, breathed from it, exists by it alone.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea, ere Saturnian earth her child consumes,<br />

Ere death&rsquo;s grim tongue anticipates the tomb&rsquo;s<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What aids, what

As Thunder writhes the lash of his long lightnings<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; About the growling heads of the brute main<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Foaming at mouth, until it wallow again<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the scooped oozes of its bed of pain;<br />
So all the gnashing jaws, the leaping heads<br />
Of hungry menaces, and of ravening dreads,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of pangs<br />
Twitch-lipped, with quivering nostrils and immitigate fangs,<br

I scourge beneath the torment of my charms<br />
That their repentless nature fear to work thee harms.<br />
And as yon Apollonian harp-player,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yon wandering
psalterist of the sky,<br />
With flickering strings which scatter melody,<br />

undulous dream<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The glimmering shapes of its dim-tress&egrave;d
daughters,<br />
And missions each to be thy minister.<br />

Saying; &ldquo;O ye,<br />

The blushes on existence&rsquo;s pale face,<br />

Without whom we should but guess Heaven&rsquo;s worth<br />
By blank negations of this sordid earth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (So haply to the blind may
light<br />
Be but gloom&rsquo;s undetermined opposite);<br />
Ye who are thus as the refracting air<br />
Whereby we see Heaven&rsquo;s sun before it rise<br />
Above the dull line of our mortal skies;<br />
As breathing on the strain&egrave;d ear that sighs<br />
From comrades viewless unto strain&egrave;d eyes,<br />
Soothing our terrors in the lampless night;<br />
Ye who can make this world where all is deeming<br />
What world ye list, being arbiters of seeming;<br />
Attend upon her ways, benignant powers!<br />

Still streaming from the soul, in love&rsquo;s warm air<br />
Smokes with a mist of tender fantasies;<br />

No pain in withering, yet a joy arisen;<br />
And all thin shapes more exquisitely rare,<br />

More subtly fair,<br />
Than these weak ministering words have spell to prison<br />
Within the magic circle of this rhyme;<br />
And all the fays who in our creedless clime<br />

Have sadly ceased<br />
Bearing to other children childhood&rsquo;s proper feast;<br />
Whose robes are fluent crystal, crocus-hued,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose wings are wind a-fire, whose
mantles wrought<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From spray that

His wild bacchantes drunken<br />

At length my Ariel lays his viol by;<br />
We sing no more to thee, child, he and I;<br />

In slow wreaths folden<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around yon

Vague Vesper&rsquo;s fumes aspire;<br />

Its honey of wild flame, its jocund spilth of fire.</p>

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">When</span> the last stir
of bubbling melodies<br />
Broke as my chants sank underneath the wave<br />
Of dulcitude, but sank again to rise<br />
Where man&rsquo;s embaying mind those waters lave,<br />

Flexuously floating through their parent seas,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And such are these),<br />

The effluence of a dear desired reality?<br />

Two spirits, dim within the silver smoke<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which is for ever woke<br />
By snowing lights of fountained Poesy.<br />
Two shapes they were familiar as love;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were those souls, whereof<br

One twines from finest gracious daily things,<br />
Strong, constant, noticeless, as are heart-strings<br />
<a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>The golden

these<br />
I saw how many brought their garlands fair,<br />
Whether of song, or simple love, they were,&mdash;<br />
Of simple love, that makes best garlands fair.<br />
But one I marked who lingered still behind,<br />
As for such souls no seemly gift had he:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was not of their strain,<br />
Nor worthy of so bright beings to entertain,<br />
<a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>Nor fit
compeer for such high company.<br />
Yet was he, surely, born to them in mind,<br />
Their youngest nursling of the spirit&rsquo;s kind.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last stole this one,<br />
With timid glance, of watching eyes adread,<br />
And dropped his frightened flower when all were gone;<br />
And where the frail flower fell, it wither&egrave;d.<br />
But yet methought those high souls smiled thereon;<br />
As when a child, upstraining at your knees<br />
Some fond and fancied nothings, says, &ldquo;I give you
these!&rdquo;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
